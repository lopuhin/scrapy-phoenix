## 2026-09-28 — step 1: framework core + sandbox default-layout spider

Breakage matrix (`python scripts/matrix.py`, no healer; "fully correct" = every
scored field matches the sandbox ground truth):

| preset | items | fully correct | variants used | refused | first refusal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| default | 566 | 566/566 | CategoryPageV1 60, HomePageV1 1, ProductPageV1 566 | — |  |
| product-modern | 0 | — | CategoryPageV1 60, HomePageV1 1 | Product 566 | no Product variant accepts http://127.0.0.1:8765/sandbox-store/product/b05731fd-8916-40b7-b9ba-547e7b4bcaf8: — ProductPageV1.description [extract]: '.product-info > p' matched nothing |
| product-modern-half | 281 | 281/281 | CategoryPageV1 60, HomePageV1 1, ProductPageV1 281 | Product 285 | no Product variant accepts http://127.0.0.1:8765/sandbox-store/product/6c44821e-af05-4764-8234-af07f3e08b1f: — ProductPageV1.description [extract]: '.product-info > p' matched nothing |

| variant-dom-change | 566 | 566/566 | CategoryPageV1 60, HomePageV1 1, ProductPageV1 566 | — |  |

Observations:

- **No false positives** on the default layout: 566/566 products and 61/61
  navigation pages accepted, every item fully correct against ground truth. The
  default catalogue covers discount, out of stock, no rating and no brand.
- **No bad items under drift.** Every page was either extracted fully correctly
  or refused. In the mixed A/B run (`product-modern-half`), 281 old-layout pages
  went through V1 correctly and 285 new-layout pages were refused.
- **Detection fires where the drift is.** Product redesign: on each product page.
  `hidden-price`: only the price/currency fields, nothing else. Infinite scroll
  and load more: on the first category page (`.pagination` missing). That is
  §4.3 case 1, "pagination is always rendered", working as designed.
- **A whole-site redesign (`modern`) stops the crawl at the home page.** Only one
  page is ever seen, so the healer would get a single held page and would
  have to repair navigation before it sees any product page. That is a
  repair-in-stages case to design for (repair nav → resume → product pages are
  refused → second repair).
- `variant-dom-change` is not detected, and correctly so: only the variant picker
  changes, and variants are out of scope in the README.
- Evidence is precise enough to paste into a prompt:
  `ProductPageV1.price [extract]: '.product-info .price-tag' matched nothing`.

Friction found (candidates for a web-poet fork or for framework polish):

- web-poet creates every field coroutine before awaiting any of them, so a field
  that raises inside `to_item()` leaks "coroutine never awaited" warnings. We
  filter the warning for now.
- On failure, dispatch evaluates the fields one by one again so it can name every
  failing field. The extra cost is paid only for refused pages.
- A page type with nothing to extract but an anchor (the home page) puts its
  `must` inside the one real field. That works, but it's implicit.
- scrapy-poet is not used at all so far. Plain web-poet page objects built by
  hand are enough.
- The default catalogue has no single-page category. The `single-page`
  fixture is captured with `ITEMS_PER_PAGE=20` (same layout).
